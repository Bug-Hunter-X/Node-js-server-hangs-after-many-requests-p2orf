# Node.js Server Hanging Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js servers where the server appears to hang or become unresponsive after handling a large number of requests. The problem stems from the combination of asynchronous operations and the synchronous nature of the HTTP server's request handling.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a simple HTTP server.  When many requests are made quickly the server can get overloaded, resulting in slow responses or even a complete hang. This is because the server uses `setTimeout` to simulate a long-running task. If requests come in faster than the server can process them, the request queue will fill up and cause the issue.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using the `async/await` pattern to process requests asynchronously preventing the server from blocking.  This approach allows the server to handle many concurrent requests more efficiently.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Use a tool like `wrk` or `ab` (Apache Bench) to send many requests concurrently to `http://localhost:3000`. Observe the server's behavior.
4. Repeat the process with `node bugSolution.js` to compare the performance.

## Improvements for Production

The improved version, while functional, should not be deployed to production without further improvements such as:
* Error Handling:  Robust error handling to prevent crashes. 
* Load Balancing: For handling a large number of requests efficiently in a production setting.
* Connection Pooling:  Managing database connections efficiently.
* Caching:  To reduce the load on the server and improve response times.
